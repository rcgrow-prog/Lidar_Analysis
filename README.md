# Lidar_Analysis
A series of ArcPy scripts processing LiDAR (LAS) files and derivatives. 

Step 1: 
    
    Purpose:
    
        This Python script, written by Robert Grow in April 2025, automates the processing of LAS (LiDAR point cloud) files using ArcPy, a Python site package for ESRI’s ArcGIS Pro.

    Main Steps and Functionality:

        1. Convert LAS Files:
            Converts input LAS files to a specified projection and output location using the arcpy.conversion.ConvertLas tool.
        
        2. Compute LAS Statistics:
            Calculates and writes statistical information for the LAS dataset using arcpy.management.LasDatasetStatistics.

        3. Generate LAS Raster Outputs:
            Creates several raster datasets from the LAS file, each representing different statistics (e.g., pulse count, point count, predominant class, intensity range, elevation range) using arcpy.management.LasPointStatsAsRaster.

    How It Works:

        The script takes user input for file paths, projection, statistics output, and workspace through ArcGIS parameters.

        It sets up the workspace and allows overwriting of outputs.

        It sequentially runs the conversion, statistics computation, and raster creation steps.

        On completion, it notifies the user that all processing is complete.

    Intended Use:
        This script is designed for GIS professionals working with LiDAR data in ArcGIS, streamlining the conversion, analysis, and rasterization of LAS datasets.

Step 2: 

    Purpose:
        
        This Python script automates the creation of Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and Digital Surface Models (DSM) from LAS (LiDAR) data using ArcPy, the Python package for ArcGIS Pro.

    Main Steps and Functionality:

        1. Create LAS Dataset Layers with Filters:

            The script makes two filtered LAS dataset layers from the input LAS file:

                Ground Layer: Contains only ground points (classification code 2).

                Vegetation Layer: Contains vegetation points (classification codes 3, 4, 5).

            Additional filters specify which return values to include (e.g., last, first, single, etc.).

        2. Generate DEM and DSM Rasters:

            DEM (Digital Elevation Model): Created from the ground layer using triangulation.

            DSM (Digital Surface Model): Created from the vegetation layer using binning with the maximum value.

            Both rasters use elevation values and a cell size of 1 unit.

        3. User Inputs:

            The script is designed to be run as a script tool in ArcGIS, taking user-specified inputs for:

                Input LAS file

                Output ground and vegetation LAS layers

                Output DEM and DSM raster files

    Workflow Overview:

        Set up ArcPy environment to allow overwriting outputs.

        Define classification and return value filters for ground and vegetation.

        Create filtered LAS dataset layers for ground and vegetation.

        Generate DEM and DSM rasters from these layers.

        Output messages inform the user of progress and file locations.

    Intended Use:
        This script is ideal for GIS professionals working with LiDAR data who need to quickly extract ground and vegetation surfaces and convert them into raster elevation models for further analysis or mapping.

Step 2.1

    Purpose:
        
        This Python script automates the extraction of vegetation points from a LAS (LiDAR) dataset and generates a Digital Surface Model (DSM) raster using ArcPy, the Python library for ArcGIS Pro.

    Main Steps and Functionality::

        1. Create a Vegetation LAS Dataset Layer:

            Filters the input LAS file to include only points with specific classification codes related to vegetation and other relevant features (e.g., codes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 17, 19, 21).

            Applies a set of return value filters to further refine the selection.

            Produces a new LAS dataset layer containing only the filtered points.

        2. Generate a DSM Raster:

            Converts the filtered vegetation LAS dataset layer into a DSM raster using the "BINNING MAXIMUM LINEAR" method, which captures the highest elevation values in each cell (representing the top of vegetation and other features).

            The output is a floating-point raster with a cell size of 1 unit.

    User Inputs:

        Input LAS file path

        Output vegetation LAS dataset layer path

        Output DSM raster path

    Workflow Overview:

        The script is intended for use as a tool in ArcGIS, where users supply the required input and output paths.

        It enables overwriting of outputs by default.

        Informative messages are provided to the user after each major processing step.

    Intended Use:

        This script is ideal for GIS professionals or researchers who need to quickly extract vegetation surfaces from LiDAR data and create DSMs for further analysis, visualization, or mapping.

Step 3:

    Purpose:

        This Python script automates the generation of a comprehensive suite of terrain analysis products from both a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and a Digital Surface Model (DSM) using ArcPy in ArcGIS Pro.

    Main Steps and Functionality:

        1. User Inputs:

            The script takes three user-supplied inputs:

                A DEM raster file

                A DSM raster file

                An output workspace folder

        2. Terrain Analysis Products Generated:
        
        For both the DEM and DSM, the script creates the following raster products:

            Hillshade: Simulates sunlight and shadows for terrain visualization.

            Slope (Degree and Percent Rise): Calculates the steepness of the terrain in degrees and as a percentage.

            Aspect: Determines the compass direction that slopes face.

            Curvature Surfaces:

                Mean Curvature

                Profile Curvature

                Tangential Curvature

                Plan (Contour) Curvature

                Gaussian Curvature

            Casorati Curvature

        3. How It Works:

            The script is organized into functions for modularity and clarity:

                calculate_hillshade() computes hillshade rasters.

                calculate_surface_parameters() computes various surface parameters (slope, aspect, curvatures).

                process_dem_products() runs all analyses for a given raster (DEM or DSM) and names outputs with a prefix.

                main() handles input, workspace setup, and calls the processing functions for both DEM and DSM.

            All output rasters are saved in the specified workspace with clear, descriptive filenames.

    Intended Use:

        Designed for GIS professionals or researchers who need to quickly and consistently generate multiple terrain analysis products from elevation data.

        Streamlines repetitive tasks and ensures consistent output naming and processing.

Step 4:

    Purpose:

        This Python script automates the extraction of spectral bands, NDVI calculation, NDVI reclassification, and zonal statistics table generation from a multiband raster image using ArcPy and ArcGIS Spatial Analyst.

    Main Steps and Functionality:

        1. User Inputs:
        The script takes user-supplied parameters for:

            Multiband raster input

            Output paths for individual band layers (Bands 1–4)

            Workspace directory

            Crop boundary feature class and the field for zonal statistics

        2. Band Extraction:

            Extracts four individual bands from the input raster and saves them as separate raster layers.

            Typical bands:

                Band 1: Blue

                Band 2: Green

                Band 3: Red

                Band 4: Near-Infrared (NIR)

        3. NDVI Calculation:

            Computes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using the Red and NIR bands:

            NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)

            Saves the NDVI raster to the workspace.

        4. NDVI Reclassification:

            Reclassifies the NDVI raster into discrete vegetation health classes (low, medium, high, etc.) based on NDVI value ranges.

            Saves the reclassified raster.

        5. Zonal Statistics Table:

            Computes zonal statistics for NDVI values within each crop boundary zone, summarizing NDVI statistics per field or plot.

            Outputs the results as a table.

    Workflow Overview: 
        
        The script is modular, with each major processing step encapsulated in a function.

        The main() function orchestrates the workflow: setting up the workspace, extracting bands, calculating NDVI, reclassifying NDVI, and generating zonal statistics.

        Output files are clearly named and saved in the specified workspace.

        Informative messages are provided throughout for user feedback.

    Intended Use:

        This script is ideal for GIS professionals and remote sensing analysts who need to efficiently process multispectral imagery for vegetation analysis, particularly in agricultural or environmental monitoring applications.

Step 5:

                An NDVI raster

                The workspace directory for outputs

        3. Band Normalization:

            Each input band is converted to a floating-point raster and normalized to a 0–1 scale for consistent index calculation.

        4. Vegetation and Soil Index Calculations:
    
            The script calculates and saves the following indices:

                EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index)

                MSAVI and MSAVI2 (Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Indices)

                CLG (Chlorophyll Index - Green)

                GNDVI (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)

                Iron Oxide Ratio

                MTVI2 (Modified Triangular Vegetation Index)

                NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)

                SR (Simple Ratio)

                VARI (Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index)

                EVI-NDVI Difference: Compares EVI and NDVI values pixel by pixel

        5. Reclassification:

            EVI Reclassification: Classifies EVI values into discrete vegetation health classes.
